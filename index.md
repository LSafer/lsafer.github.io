# **Me And My Policy**

- ### **Open Source**
I do not keep my code for myself. I share my code at GitHub for everyone to benefit from it. I just want my name to be kept mentioned for my rights.

- ### **Love to Code**
I code just because I enjoy coding. I do not mind even if my code has not been used. But I do not code useless code.

---

# **Programming Environments**

- ### **Android Applications**
I used to make android applications for the past two years.

- ### **Linux Knowledge**
I know the required knowledge to use Linux. And how to deal with the Display Manager and Root.

- ### **Lower Level Understanding**
I know the required knowledge to understand what is the relation between CPU, RAM and ROM and the GPU. And I have read about how to do build a
running simple system using a simple CPU and a RAM and a ROM. And how to output to a real display from ROM just using a simple CPU.

- ### **Concurrent and Threading**
I can deal with threading. And split the work between threads. I can link between two or more threads. And make them contact and notify each other.

- ### **Code Art**
I can not write code without making it as simple and universal as possible. I make my code more beautiful and clear for the reader and me.

- ### **Reflections and Automation**
When something can be automated using reflection (In Java. Or relevant to it). I always take that way and make automation for it.

- ### **Library Building**
I have experienced building Java libraries. And I could say that all my experience in building libraries is shortened in one library
[(the cufy framework)](https://cufyorg.github.io/framework).

# **Programming Languages**

- ### **Java**
I'm good at the backend. And not bad at the frontend. I'm good at using reflection. Also good at managing resources. I could deal with any kind of
problem when it's about interfaces and inheritance.

- ### **Groovy**
I know the basics of groovy. And since it based on java. I can work around almost any problem.

- ### **C++**
I know the basics of C++. And with little practice, I could be good at it.

- ### **HTML, CSS, JavaScript**
I used to program in these languages 3 years ago. But after I start programming in Java, I left web development.
